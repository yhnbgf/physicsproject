# physicsproject
HCI physics project from arduino


Physics.ino file is for arduino uno
Nano.ino is on nano.

Made nano and uno interact, by nano transmitting current from an analogue pin to uno. 
Uno measured voltage and current, and started solenoid from there

Videos and pics are how the arduino was set up
